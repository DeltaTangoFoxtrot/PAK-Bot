PAK respects the discretion and privacy of all members, as well as the staff and hosts of venues. If you attend a public event:

1. Dress appropriately. Do not wear fetish wear that would expose attendees to being outed. Err on the side of caution and wear something you would wear to the grocery store or school.

2. Act appropriately. Overly inebriated behavior, touching without consent, being rude to wait staff or hosts, or engaging in exhibitionist play will lose the group's ability to host at public venues. Please be respectful of event spaces at all times. If you can not respect this, you will be asked to leave.
